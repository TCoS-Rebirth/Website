## Spellborn Reborn
Since the shutdown, a group of enthousiasts started a project called Spellborn Reborn. Together they tried reverse engineering the game, trying to create a game server for people to join.

Now, more than 10 years later, the moment has finally come for everybody to play this rough diamond once more, complete with new bugfixes and unreleased content.

Set foot in the Enclave and amaze yourself once more of the stunning shards that the game offers.
