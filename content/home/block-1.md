## About the game
The Chronicles of Spellborn was first released in November 2008 by the Dutch company Spellborn NV. The game was marked as an MMORPG, but stood out from the rest because of its unique art style and combat system.

However, it had a troublesome launch, and after being online for just 2 years the game's servers were shut down.
