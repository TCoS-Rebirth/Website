  <p>To celebrate that, we have a new update!</p>

  <h2>Update notes, version 1.1.0.5c</h2>

        <ul>
                        <li><b>He Remains Powerful</b> - Fixed missing quest parts. Fixed empty text in conversations.</li>
                        <li><b>A Token of Sincerity</b> - Fixed despawning of Vednidher when he reaches the end of his escort.</li>
