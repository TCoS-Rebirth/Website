What started a few months ago as a stroke of pure luck, allowing us to get back on the game, has evolved to a point that we are comfortable opening it up to others - which means, we don't expect to do any further character wipes, but as long as the beta runs, that chance might still be there.

The game itself is the latest version of The Chronicles of Spellborn that was available running under Acclaim - we were able to get our hands on the Asian version of TCoS that underwent heavy changes, but this turned out not to be the best pick.

Several bugs have been fixed, broken quests fixed and even closed content reopened, which makes this, without doubt, the best version of The Chronicles of Spellborn that has ever been available.

## Enough talking, how can I get in?
I like how impatient you are!

The steps are quite easy:

1. Register on the forums - this is needed so you can report bugs or issues. If you already have an account, you can skip this step :)  
 <a class="button" data-open="registerForumAccount">Create forum account</a>
2. Join the beta group on the forums - this way, we can notify you when there are updates.  
<a class="button" data-open="joinBetaGroup">Join the Open beta group on the forums</a>
3. Register a game account - for security reasons, don't use your **account name** as a character name.  
 <a class="button" data-open="registerGameAccount">Create game account</a>
4. Download the client - you can always find the latest version on the homepage, or download it by using this button:  
 <a class="button" href="https://files.spellborn.org/latest.zip">Download latest version of Spellborn</a>
5. Unzip the game on a place of you liking, run the bin\Client\Sb_client.exe file and enjoy the game!
