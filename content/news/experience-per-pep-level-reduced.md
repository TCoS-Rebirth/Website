Hello dear Shard-traveller!

With our latest update, 1.1.1.2, which went live a week ago, we lowered the PeP requirements to get a new level.

This is a massive change to how the game plays, as PeP-levels give nice boosts - however, when you die, you lose a PeP level and the benefit it gives.

Due to some nasty things in the game - like the infamous ladders - we decided to lower the requirements, to make the pain of losing a PeP level a bit more bearable.

Starting from now, the requirements have been slashed by 50% and are now:

- PeP level 1: 2500
- PeP level 2: 6500
- PeP level 3: 12500
- PeP level 4: 20000
- PeP level 5: 30000

We hope that you'll like this change and we wish you a lot of fun in the game!

- Kevin and the Spellborn team!
