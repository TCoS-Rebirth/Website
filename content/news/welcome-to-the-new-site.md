**Hi.**
A lot has been moving over the last few months - from having lost almost all hope of playing Spellborn again, to a time where we actively can play the game again - what a time to be alive!.

This ofcourse required a new website, as the requirements for a live game are completely different from those of a dead game, so the website has been built from the ground up (using Hugo) to accommodate the game itself. We will be able to post news articles here, update notes, screenshots and so much more!

So be sure to come back often, since things are going to move around here quickly!

- Yours truly, Kevin
