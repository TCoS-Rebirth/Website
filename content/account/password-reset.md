It's currently not possible to reset your password - but it is possible for us to set up a new password for you.

In order to get your password reset, please direct message either Kevin, SpellbornDev or AcidBurnElite on the forums (or Discord) to reset your password.
Be prepared to send proof that the account belongs to you, by including character names on your account.
