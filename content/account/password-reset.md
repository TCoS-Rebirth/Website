Since July 2023, it is now possible to reset your game account password using the Spellborn Account system, which you can find on <https://account.spellborn.org>.

Forgot your password? Unfortunately, unless you have a Spellborn Account, we can only manually reset this.
In order to get your password reset, please direct message either Kevin, SpellbornDev or AcidBurnElite on the forums (or Discord) to reset your password.
Be prepared to send proof that the account belongs to you, by including character names on your account.
