So you have decided to join the Enclave of the Five Sacrifices and want to make the beautiful world of The Chronicles of Spellborn a better place? Welcome!

Follow these steps to jump into the game.

## Download the game client
Before you can start and play, you will need to download our launcher which will download the game and keep it up-to-date.

The main version of the launcher only runs on newer operating systems like Windows 10/11. We however also provide an older version of the launcher which does support Windows Vista/8/7/XP but does not receive new features (new game updates are still installed, no worries).
If you run Windows 10 or 11, please use the newest launcher to avoid issues.

**Warning: the launcher currently does not support resuming downloads, so keep in mind that once you start the launcher, it will download about 5 GB.**

## Create a Spellborn Account and create your game account
To play The Chronicles of Spellborn, you need to have a master account called a Spellborn Account. This master account is used to create game accounts and to reset the passwords of your game accounts.
You can not use a Spellborn Account to log into the game directly, but use it to login to our Account-website. Once logged in there, you can create your game account.

Getting started is very easy:
1. <a class="button" href="https://account.chroniclesofspellborn.com/user/signup" title="Create a Spellborn Account" target="_blank">Create a Spellborn Account</a>.
2. Once your account has been created, click the registration confirmation link that has been sent to you by mail.
3. <a class="button" href="https://account.chroniclesofspellborn.com/user/login" title="Log into your Spellborn Account">Log into your Spellborn Account</a>.
4. <a class="button" href="https://account.chroniclesofspellborn.com/game/create-account" title="Create a game account">Create a game account</a>.

The account that you create in step 4 is the one you use to log into the game with. You can also perform these steps from within the launcher itself.
Should you ever need to reset your game account password, you can log in to your Spellborn Account and reset the password there. Once reset in the Account System, the new password is active immediately.


## Known issues and how to resolve these

The Chronicles of Spellborn is an old game and has some known issues. The most important one is that the game runs poorly when ran at higher than 60FPS.

<p>Please make sure to limit the game to 60 FPS - the game can encounter issues if not locked to 60 FPS. </p>
