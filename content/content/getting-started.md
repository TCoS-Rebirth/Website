A new downloader/patcher is currently being worked on, so in the meantime you'll have to follow the steps listed below.  
These are quite easy. You'll be in Hawksmouth in no time!

## 1. Register on the forums
This is needed so you can report bugs or issues.  
If you already have an account, you can skip this step.  
<a class="cta btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="https://forum.spellborn.org/member.php?action=register" target="_blank">Create forum account</a>

## 2. Join the beta group on the forums
If you're part of the open beta group, we can notify you when there are updates.

## 3. Register a game account
You'll obviously need a game account to play the game.  
Note: For security reasons, don't use your **account name** as a character name!  
<a class="cta btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="https://www.spellborn.nl" target="_blank">Create game account</a>

## 4. Download the client
You can always find the latest version in this site's menu (The Game > Download Latest Client), but right now you can download it right here.  
<a class="cta btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="https://files.spellborn.org/latest.zip">Download latest version of Spellborn</a>

## 5. Install the Client
Unzip the game to your harddrive in a folder your choice, run the *bin\Client\Sb_client.exe* file and enjoy the game!
