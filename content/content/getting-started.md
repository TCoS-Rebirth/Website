  <p>Hello everybody - the last few weeks have been amazing and we're now up at 900 accounts!</p>
  <p>To celebrate that, we have a new update!</p>

  <h2>Update notes, version 1.1.0.5c</h2>
        <span class="label label-success">Quest fixes</span>
        <ul>
                        <li><b>He Remains Powerful</b> - Fixed missing quest parts. Fixed empty text in conversations.</li>
                        <li><b>A Token of Sincerity</b> - Fixed despawning of Vednidher when he reaches the end of his escort.</li>
                        <li><b>Palace Love</b> - Fixed missing conversations at the end of the quest.</li>
                        <li><b>Time For A Change Of Style</b> - Changed the war scene location in the quest text from north of the docks to south of the docks.</li>
                        <li><b>Mugwum Is Guilty!</b> - Fixed Mugwum not despawning when he is at the gate. This prevents new players from interacting with him.</li>
                        <li><b>The Pedestal Of Light</b> - History book was invisible so it was impossible to find the correct order.</li>
