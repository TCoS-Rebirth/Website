## Create a game account
In order to play Spellborn, you will need to create a game account.

You can create one by going to the account-creation page by using the button below.

**Please do NOT use your account name as a character name, for security reasons.**

**Note your password or store it in a password manager, since resetting your password is currently only possible by contacting a GM.**

## Download the game client
The suggested (and only supported way) of download Spellborn is through our launcher.
This launcher will install and keep Spellborn up-to-date.

<a class="button" href="https://files.spellborn.org/launcher/launcher-installer.exe" title="Download launcher" target="_blank">Download launcher</a>
<a class="button secondary" href="https://files.spellborn.org/launcher/installer.exe" title="Download old launcher (for Windows Vista/8/XP)" target="_blank">Download old launcher (for Windows Vista/8/XP)</a>

**The launcher currently does not support resuming downloads, hopefully we'll be able to add that in the future.**

Should you have issues with the launcher, please ask a question on the forums or on our Discord-server.

A debugging tool for the launcher is currently being worked on.

Upon launching the launcher, it will install the game.

## Register on the forums.
This is not required, but highly suggested since this is the location where bugs can be reported or when you get stuck.

You can also find quest help here.
