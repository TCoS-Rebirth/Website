  <h2>High House Rune</h2>
  <p>What started a few months ago as a stroke of pure luck, allowing us to get back on the game, has evolved to a point that we are comfortable opening it up to others - which means, we don't expect to do any further character wipes, but as long as the beta runs, that chance might still be there.</p>
  <p>The game itself is the latest version of The Chronicles of Spellborn that was available running under Acclaim - we were able to get our hands on the Asian version of TCoS that underwent heavy changes, but this turned out not to be the best pick.</p>
