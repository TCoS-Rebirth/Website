<h2>Rogues</h2>
<p>Eschewing knowledge or force for more practical means, the Rogues were not the most numerous but according to the Sekk-Sotyll Scrolls still formed a comprehensive group. Petty thieves and scoundrels were included as well and as such the Archetype missed a clear goal. It was only after the Great Collapse that these elements somehow reformed and strengthened their influence. Whether it be magic, mechanics or natural occurrences, the Rogues now use and abuse whatever they can get their hands upon, often with little regard for the consequences.</p>

<h2>Skinshifter</h2>
<p>These rogues are masters of changing their shape. The Skinshifter makes for an efficient and deadly assassin, and possesses a variety of melee as well as ranged combat skills. They are also considered the most adept practitioners of the art of stealth.</p>
<p>“What roles? AHA, while solo Skinshifters are lethal, sneaky and deadly! Might not be handy in a group…You can easily deduce that we are more suitable on our own to preserve a better camouflage. But in a group? YES, we can fit in! But I don’t think that would work as well…Though our delicate offensive capabilities could potentially wreak havoc in a suitably controlled environment”<i>– Master Skinshifter Shift, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Trickster</h2>
<p>A stealthy and nimble combatant, the Trickster makes use of illusions and sleight of hand in order to gain the upper hand. They can also create small devices which enhance their abilities and can be used to confuse and injure opponents. They are also renowned for their speed.
</p>
<p>The Trickster skills focus on evasion. Nothing in the game will be harder to hit then a fully developed Trickster. His speed makes up for the little damage he can do.
</p>
<p>“The thing that makes Tricksters especially dangerous is how they can cover large groups of enemies. Allowing for teleportation Skills also gives the Trickster an edge getting out of harm’s way. Tricksters are slippery. For groups it is therefore quite fascinating to have a Trickster amongst them. As the effects can be quite beneficial, though potentially a bit dangerous. On its own a Trickster may be very erratic in its behaviour. For a Trickster it’s really more about having fun and annoying its opponents. To death even.” –<i>Master Trickster Nolden Krainstyn, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Deathhand</h2>
<p>Poisons form the backbone of a Death Hand's arsenal. Death Hands have a powerful array of skills which involve their knowledge of poisons, and they are particularly adept at facing a large number of foes. For this reason, they are most often found lending their support to a group of their allies.</p>
<p>By consuming different potions the Death Hand can use his body to develop a lethal fighting style that can deal a lot of damage with an added damage over time (DoT) component to one or more targets.</p>
<p>“We’re the guys in the back. Or the front. Or on someone’s back. It doesn’t matter, really. We get in, do our stuff and soften up the competition. Then we let the others do their thing and maybe help them out even. We’re great in groups. Alone though…Well, you need to watch out. Poisoning you opponents is dead handy, but if you can’t last as long as your poison works it’s pretty pointless, you know. Everything’s better in a group. Really.”<i>– Master Deathhand Nhiana Flammeon, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2> Warriors</h2>
<p>The Sekk-Sotyll Scrolls defined the Warrior Archetype as being the oldest one there is and also as being the Archetype with the largest amount of Disciplines. Pre-Collapse there were literally hundreds of them; most of them based upon 20 individual weapon mastery or specific attack patterns. Post-Collapse a lot of that knowledge was lost resulting in the focused set that exists today. As long as there is conflict or a frontier Warriors will always be needed and in the early days of the Deadspell Storm their might was certainly appreciated.</p>

<h2>Adept</h2>
<p>Practitioners of martial combat, Adepts are gifted with a variety of powerful methods of sight. Their special vision is very useful under the proper circumstances. They make excellent leaders and are often found commanding forces in battle.</p>
<p>The Adept has few armed skills. Most of the offensive skills of the Adept are unarmed fighting skills. The Adept will be able to disarm, slow and silence opponents as well as keep people alive by healing, making him quite a tactical class to play.</p>
<p>“The Adept is a Discipline for survivors and explorers. If you need to get in and out of combat quickly the way of the Adept is certainly an efficient route. They may be a bit difficult to work with though. Adepts in general favour their independence.”<i>– Master Adept Seregrin Carnyxian, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Wrathguard</h2>
<p>The Wrathguard is an adherent to the ways of the ancestors and as such a Wrathguard has the ability to use their knowledge of the past to channel the spirits of warriors long-fallen. They are unrivaled in their skill in arms due to their inheritance of the knowledge possessed by the ancestral spirits they command.</p>
<p>Wrathguards allow ancestral spirits to posses them in order to unleash their unique fighting abilities. Certain spirits grant buffs to the entire group while active or cause havoc when a Wrathguard transfers the spirit possession to enemies.</p>
<p>"Wrathguards are born leaders! We command, we group, we direct and we enforce! We know how to wage battle and when to evoke the power of the Crests. In a group, we are unbeatable! Alone we can wage war just as well, though it should be clear that without a group a Wrathguard wastes its potential! And wasting potential is frowned upon!"<i>- Master Wrathguard Merald Heragon, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Bloodwarrior</h2>
<p>The Blood Warrior is considered the ultimate ‘tank’. Blood Warriors have superior defensive abilities than the other two warrior classes, at the cost of some offensive power. The Blood Warrior has many personal buffs, most of these are personal buffs focusing on damage mitigation.</p>
<p>Blood Warriors are able to create a link between themselves and either a friend or a foe. If the link is made with an ally, the Blood Warrior will act as a bodyguard for that specific character. If the link is made with a foe the Blood Warrior can redirect incoming damage to an enemy.</p>
<p>Taking damage is the primary source for the offensive abilities of the Blood Warrior. As the Blood Warrior grows in power he will be able to make additional links to friends and foes, thus increasing his defensive or offensive abilities. The Blood Warrior receives many combat skills that focus on establishing blood links and using them effectively.</p>
<p>“A single Bloodwarrior may have a hard time. Will almost certainly die unless he can control his abilities. The Scars' power is intoxicating and can be use again and again without limit. I’ve seen many a Bloodwarrior go on a murderous rampage only to burn himself up completely. In a group though, a Bloodwarrior is essential. We can stay in combat for a long time and crush our enemies. Our Scars allow us to weaken opponents and soften them up for our teammates, while they look out for us. But as said: alone, without any support, it’s going to be harder and those who are too eager… Well, they will die.”<i>– Master Bloodwarrior Alkard Pettera, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Spellcasters</h2>
<p>The youngest Archetype is without a doubt the Spellcasters. Every piece of knowledge this Archetype possessed was learned from the Vhelgar and like them their ancestral magics were ultimately drawn from the Altar of the Undying. Their newfound knowledge was developed and weaved into complex spells and patterns to repay the Vhelgar in kind. But as this Archetype exploded in diversity as the opposition against the Vhelgar grew, so it was almost crippled after the Great Collapse. The Deadspell Storm had tampered with the laws of magic and mages were forced to start anew; ancestral magics now being a thing of the past.</p>

<h2>Ancesteral Mage</h2>
<p>Commanding spirits from the past, the Ancestral Mage is a dangerous force to be reckoned with. While the Ancestral Mage does not have much personal power, they are capable of significantly enhancing their summoned spirit pets as well as their companions.</p>
<p>“That’s the most wonderful thing; an Ancestral Mage is never alone! Ancestral Mages can be quite solitary and keep themselves out of harm’s way pretty well, by using their Spirit Pets to their utmost efficiency. The bond between you and your Spirit Pet can become quite strong. And at the same time Ancestral Mages can be ideal in a group, keeping overview and commanding their Spirit Pets to offensive effect, while supporting everyone with their magical abilities. It really is quite nice, dear. Wreaks havoc on opposing forces though.”<i>– Master Ancestral Mage Kimian the Quartehr, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Rune Mage</h2>
<p>Rune Mages are arcane savants possessing powerful destructive magic. They are also unique in their ability to create runes that enhance the power of themselves and others. A Rune Mage can be an imposing enemy due to their offensive power, as well as an invaluable ally on account of their rune mastery.</p>
<p>The Rune Mage receives many skills that focus on wielding destructive magic. They also have a large arsenal of skills that allow them to create Area of Effect (AoE) spells by drawing runes on the ground and manipulating them. Rune Mages are most often found in the midst of a fight adding fuel to the heat of battle.</p>
<p>“We Runemages tend to have lots of spells at the ready allowing us to target multiple enemies or groups. We’re good at thinning the pack, which can be quite handy in a party. On our own we have pretty much all that is needed to survive. Runemages are pretty versatile, all things considered.”<i>– Master Runemage Gerreth Bournbray, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>

<h2>Void Seer</h2>
<p>Through their devotion to the Oracle, these mages are gifted with powerful magical abilities that counteract the spells of others. The Void Seer is quite adept at mending the wounds all too often suffered within the scattered Shards, as well as providing magical reinforcement to their allies. They can severely weaken the magic of enemies, and as such are often found in the company of many friends.</p>
<p>The Void Seer has very few offensive skills. Almost all of the skills and spells are defensive and used to enhance the abilities of party members. The only offensive skills a Void Seer has are his anti-magic skills but even most of these types of skills are about prevention rather than damage. Void Seer, with his constant healing, reflections, debuffing and dotting, can hold enemy for a long time, slowly exhausting him, and eventually killing him.</p>
<p>“We Void Seers are here to guide and heal those in need. We can fight alongside our allies, but we can also sense their troubles and help them when needed most. On our own we can roam everywhere we want, safe in the knowledge that if we truly follow the Awareness of the Oracle and make use of its guidance, that we can survive anywhere. We are wanted and needed at many places, indeed.” <i>– Master Void Seer Isarah Nunuse, The Academy, Hawksmouth</i></p>
